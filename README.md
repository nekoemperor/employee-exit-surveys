## About:
The dataset we'll use describes Euro daily exchange rates between 1999 and 2021. The euro (symbolized with €) is the official currency in most of the countries of the European Union.

If the exchange rate of the euro to the US dollar is 1.5, you get 1.5 US dollars if you pay 1.0 euro (one euro has more value than one US dollar at this exchange rate).

## Note:
Daria Chemkaeva put together the data set and made it available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lsind18/euro-exchange-daily-rates-19992020) — the data source is the European Central Bank. Note that the dataset gets regular updates — we downloaded it on January 2021.

## Goals:
The aim of this project is to determine time series of foreign exchange rates per 1 Euro.

## Technologies:
Project is created with:
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
